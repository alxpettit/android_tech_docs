#### What do you use/recommend hardware-wise? I want a phone that I can do Linux-y things with.

As of this writing, I mostly use old Nexus devices. I have an assortment of Nexus 5 and Nexus 5x units, which can recieve regular security updates far past their bullshit fake end-of-life if you know how to use custom ROMs. These units are, out of date, and thus extremely cheap to buy refurbished/used/in-pieces-awaiting repair.

However, they are fairly poor security due to the binary blobs, so as a general rule I don't put any of my core private keys on them, or anything super private. However, if you use Windows as your daily driver I assure you that these security standards are far higher than anything you should be concerned with. I mean... crap, that sounded condescending, didn't it? Sorry. What I mean is that... um...

An old Android phone that is recieving third-party ROM updates is a _lot_ less likely to be hacked than a Windows computer. Let's just... leave it at that.


#### Okay, okay, I get it, locked bootloaders are bad.

There are other things to look at and ask yourself too. For example "Am I willing to build my own images?" If you don't have the skills or the time to do so, you'll want to get a model that is non-obscure enough to be supported by the custom ROM you plan to use.
